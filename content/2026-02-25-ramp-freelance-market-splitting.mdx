**For every $1 companies cut from freelancers, they spent $0.03 on AI. Ramp's data across thousands of firms.**

Over half the businesses using freelance marketplaces in 2022 stopped entirely by 2025. Labor spend dropped from **0.66%** to **0.14%** of total spend.

But look at what got cut. "Build me a landing page." "Write a CRUD API." "Fix this CSS." Commodity output.  

The freelance work that's growing is the opposite end. Architecture and delivering a scalable serverless backend that solves actual issues. Production AI with sub-second latency budgets. Deploying AI agents with per-tenant isolation on AWS.

**Coding is one part of the job**. Architecture, failure modes, what happens at 3 AM when the provider rate-limits you. That's the rest. AI made the first part faster. It didn't touch the second.

If you're still selling hours of code output, what's your plan?
