Claude Opus 4.6 just landed on AWS Bedrock. In 3 days, OpenAI is deprecating GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini from ChatGPT.  
  
New models arrive. Old models disappear. If your AI product can't swap models fast, you've got a problem on both ends.  
  
In the past, I built an AI assistant on a smart building platform using Bedrock Agents with Claude. From day one, one architectural decision changed everything:  
Abstract every LLM call behind an interface. No hardcoded model IDs. No vendor lock-in. No scattered API calls across the codebase.  
  
When a new model drops, one config change. When a model gets deprecated, same thing. No code rewrite.  
  
On a separate project, a code review tool, I took it further. Multi-LLM routing by task complexity. Syntax checks go to a lighter model. Complex logic review goes to the heavy hitter.  
Result: 40% cost reduction. Same quality.  
  
Still hardcoding model IDs across your codebase? That's not stability. That's technical debt with a countdown timer.  
  
What model are you running in production, and how fast could you switch if it got deprecated tomorrow?
