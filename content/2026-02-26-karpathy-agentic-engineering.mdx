Karpathy defined "**vibe coding**" a year ago. He just killed the term.

The replacement: "**agentic engineering**." You're not writing code. You're orchestrating agents and reviewing their output.

I develop with AI daily. Here's what actually changed
  
- **Prompting got easier**: Architectural precision matters more than clever prompts. Define your architectural decision first and you will be good.

- **Review got harder:** The agent writes fast. Catching bad error handling, missed edge cases, security gaps? That's on you. Have you thought about the user who is going to do C while the AI only planned A, B because of its token limit?

- **Architecture didn't change:** Which patterns to use, how components fail, what breaks at scale. AI doesn't help here.

The skill gap isn't prompting. It's the same gap it's always been: can you architect, can you review and validate properly, do you know the failure modes.

If you're shipping with AI agents daily, what surprised you most about what changed and what didn't?
