Hey there! I'm Valentin, a French expatriate living in Taiwan since 2019. Curious about how I managed to stay in Taiwan all these years? My administrative journey here went from a Working Holiday Visa, to a company-sponsored Work Visa, to the coveted Taiwan Gold Card. In this article, I'd like to share what the Taiwan Gold Card is, how the process went for me, and a few links that might be helpful.

# What is the Taiwan Gold Card?

Created in 2018, the Taiwan Gold Card is the golden ticket for expats like me to stay and work in Taiwan seamlessly. It serves as both a work permit and a resident visa, allowing you to legally reside and work in Taiwan without being tied to a specific employer. As Sam, [a foreigner who became a Taiwanese citizen after a few years](https://medium.com/@SamTaiwan/from-taiwan-gold-card-to-a-taiwanese-citizen-7ed65bb07f28), puts it: the Taiwan Gold Card is Taiwan's version of a **"foreign talent acquisition"** program.

With it, you can stay for up to 3 years, access certain tax benefits (only above a specific income threshold), and even bring your family. Unlike regular work visas, the Gold Card doesn't restrict you to a particular job, making it a flexible choice for expats. That flexibility was the main reason I applied for it.

As of early November 2023, the Gold Card application costs between 100 USD and 310 USD, depending on your nationality and the desired duration. For official details, visit the [Gold Card Official Website](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/about/).

# Determining Your Eligibility

To be eligible, you need to work in specific fields such as Architecture, Culture, Art, Digital, Science & Tech, among others. You'll need to demonstrate valuable skills and experience in your field, and meet additional criteria such as holding a Ph.D. or having over 8 years of experience.

The [official website](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/qualification/) provides detailed criteria, and there's even a handy questionnaire to help you determine if you qualify.

# The Application Steps

The application process is straightforward. Gather the required documents and apply through the [official platform](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/apply/). Once submitted, your application goes through review by various governmental agencies.

The process typically takes anywhere from 30 to 90 days, depending on the documents you provide and whether any issues come up. My application took a total of 54 days from submission to picking up the card. Here's the timeline:

- **August 24:** Application submitted online
- **August 25:** Review by the National Immigration Agency
- **August 28:** Review by the Workforce Development Agency
- **September 7:** Identified missing documents
- **September 15:** Submitted missing documents
- **September 20:** Consulting with National Science and Technology Council
- **October 6:** Review by the Workforce Development Agency
- **October 11:** Review by the National Immigration Agency
- **October 11**: IC Card in process
- **October 17**: Picked up Gold Card in person
