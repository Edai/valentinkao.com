Hey there! I'm Valentin, a French expatriate living in Taiwan since 2019. Curious about how did I manage to live in Taiwan for this past years? Well, my administrative journey in Taiwan transitioned from a Working Holiday Visa, Work Visa sponsored by the company, to the coveted Taiwan Gold Card. In this article, I would like to quickly share with you, what is the Taiwan Gold Card, and few links that can be helpful !

# What is the Taiwan Gold Card?

Created in 2018, the Taiwan Gold Card is the golden ticket for expats like me to stay and work in Taiwan seamlessly. Serving as both a work permit and a resident visa, it allows you to legally reside and work in Taiwan without being tied down to a specific job. The “Taiwan Gold Card is Taiwan’s version of a **“foreign talent acquisition”** program” as defined Sam, [a foreigner who became Taiwanese citizen after few years.](https://medium.com/@SamTaiwan/from-taiwan-gold-card-to-a-taiwanese-citizen-7ed65bb07f28)

With it, you basically can stay up to 3 years, have some tax benefits (only after a certain income amount), and even bring your family. Unlike regular work visas, the Gold Card doesn't restrict you to a particular job, making it a flexible choice for expats. That's the main reason I applied for the Taiwan Gold Card.

As of early November 2023, the Gold Card application costs between 100 USD to 310 USD, depending on your nationality and the desired duration of the card. For official details, visit [Gold Card Official Website](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/about/).

# Determining Your Eligibility

To be eligible, you need to be in specific fields like Architecture, Culture, Art, Digital, Science & Tech, etc. Showcase your valuable skills and experience in your field, and meet other criteria such as holding a Ph.D. or having over 8 years of experience.

The [official website](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/qualification/) provides detailed criteria, and there's even a handy questionnaire to see if you're Gold Card material.

# The Application Steps

The application process is straightforward. Gather the required documents and apply through the [official platform](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/apply/). Once submitted, your application undergoes review by various governmental agencies.

An application can last about 30 days to 90 days, according to the documents you provided, if there is any issues, etc. My application took a total of 54 days from the date I submitted it to the day I picked my card. Check out the steps and timeline below:
